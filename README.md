tmmount
=======

Are you using `netatalk` to run a Time Machine server on your Linux machine?
`tmmount` provides an easy way to mount and unmount Time Machine sparse
bundles.

This project contains two scripts:

* `tmmount` - mount a Time Machine sparse bundle for read-only browsing.
* `tmumount` - unmount a Time Machine sparse bundle mounted by `tmmount`
